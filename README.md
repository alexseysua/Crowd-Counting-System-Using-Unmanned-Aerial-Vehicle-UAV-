# Crowd-Counting-System-Using-Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicle-UAV-
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has created much significance in recent times. It is the booming technology which are mostly used in military applications, their use is rapidly expanding to commercial, scientific, agricultural and other applications. In this research, we proposed a model to estimate the density of crowd from aerial view. Our model used Gaussian Kernels to create the heat map (density map), which is used to estimate crowd in an image. We had deployed our model on raspberry pi to estimate crowd in real time from aerial view which has significant accuracy.
